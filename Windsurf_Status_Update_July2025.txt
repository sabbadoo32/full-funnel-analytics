🌊 Windsurf: 3D Full-Funnel Integration System  
Status Update – July 2025

🎯 Purpose

Windsurf is Michigan United’s data integration layer for full-funnel strategy. It merges raw campaign data (social, email, web, CTV, Impactive, Mobilize) into one coherent, analyzable format. The goal is to:

- Map awareness → engagement → conversion pathways across all channels.
- Validate what campaigns actually move people — not just impressions or clicks.
- Create actionable, testable feedback loops between comms + organizing.

🔍 Current State

✅ Foundation Built
- Schema Template Complete: Crosswalks all relevant fields from FB, IG, Email, Mobilize, GA, Impactive, and CTV.
- Funnel Strategy Locked: Awareness → Engagement → Consideration → Conversion → Advocacy stages mapped per channel.
- Field Expansion Approved: Tracker fields now allow GA proof, geo-breakouts, CTV segment attribution.

🛠 Prototype Progress
- Tracker schema is aligned with raw field coverage from all current platforms.
- Source validation + metric enforcement protocols set (e.g., no unverified engagement rates).

🔲 Remaining Gaps
- No full campaign test run completed in new format
- No real-time or automated stitching across platforms yet
- GA → Mobilize attribution not visualized
- Impactive + CTV integrations remain untested
