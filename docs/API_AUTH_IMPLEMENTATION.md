# Full Funnel API Authentication Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation details for fixing the API authentication issues in the Full Funnel Analytics project.

## Problem Statement

The CustomGPT integration was failing with a `401 Unauthorized` error when attempting to connect to the Full Funnel API. This was preventing the CustomGPT from retrieving live data for analytical queries.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing CORS Headers**: The CORS middleware was not configured to allow the `Authorization` header, causing preflight requests to fail.
2. **Environment Variable Inconsistency**: The Netlify deployment environment variables were not synchronized with local development.
3. **Authentication Method Confusion**: The API was expecting `x-api-key` but CustomGPT was sending `Authorization: Bearer`.
4. **Incorrect API Endpoint Path**: The API endpoint URL in the CustomGPT configuration was missing the `/.netlify/functions` path prefix.
5. **Incorrect Server URL Configuration**: The OpenAPI schema in the CustomGPT action had an incorrect server URL (`https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app` instead of `https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app/.netlify/functions`).

## Implementation Details

### 1. CORS Configuration Fix

Updated the CORS middleware to explicitly include the `Authorization` header:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'x-api-key', 'Authorization']
}));
```

### 2. Dual Authentication Support

Implemented support for both authentication methods:

```javascript
// Authentication middleware
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
  // Get API key from request headers
  const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'] || 
                (req.headers.authorization && req.headers.authorization.startsWith('Bearer ') 
                  ? req.headers.authorization.substring(7) 
                  : null);
  
  // Verify API key
  if (!apiKey || apiKey !== process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY) {
    console.error('Authentication failed: Invalid API key');
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized: Invalid API key' });
  }
  
  next();
};
```

### 3. Environment Variable Verification

Created a script to verify and synchronize environment variables between local development and Netlify:

```javascript
// scripts/verify-netlify-env.js
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
const fs = require('fs');
require('dotenv').config();

// Check if Netlify CLI is installed
try {
  execSync('netlify --version');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Netlify CLI is not installed. Please install it with: npm install -g netlify-cli');
  process.exit(1);
}

// Get Netlify environment variables
const netlifyEnv = JSON.parse(execSync('netlify env:list --json').toString());

// Check for required variables
const requiredVars = ['OPENAI_API_KEY', 'MONGODB_URI'];
const missingVars = [];

for (const varName of requiredVars) {
  if (!netlifyEnv.find(env => env.key === varName)) {
    missingVars.push(varName);
    
    // If variable exists locally, set it in Netlify
    if (process.env[varName]) {
      console.log(`Setting ${varName} in Netlify from local environment...`);
      execSync(`netlify env:set ${varName} "${process.env[varName]}"`);
    } else {
      console.error(`Missing required environment variable: ${varName}`);
    }
  }
}

if (missingVars.length === 0) {
  console.log('All required environment variables are set in Netlify.');
} else {
  console.error(`Missing required environment variables in Netlify: ${missingVars.join(', ')}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### 4. Deployment Script

Created a deployment script to automate the verification and deployment process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy-api-fix.sh

# Make script exit on any error
set -e

# Verify environment variables
echo "Verifying Netlify environment variables..."
node scripts/verify-netlify-env.js

# Deploy to Netlify
echo "Deploying to Netlify..."
cd backend-deploy
netlify deploy --prod

# Test API connection
echo "Testing API connection..."
curl -X POST https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/chat/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message":"Test connection"}'

echo "Deployment complete!"
```

### 5. Updated Documentation

Updated the CustomGPT setup guide with detailed instructions for:
- Deploying the API with correct environment variables
- Configuring the CustomGPT with the correct API endpoint
- Testing the API connection
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Testing and Verification

The implementation was tested using:

1. **Direct API Testing**: Using curl commands to test the API endpoints with both authentication methods.
2. **Integration Testing**: Using the `test-customgpt-integration.js` script to simulate CustomGPT API calls.
3. **Environment Verification**: Using the `verify-netlify-env.js` script to ensure all required variables are set.
4. **CustomGPT Testing**: Testing the CustomGPT with analytical queries to verify it can access live data.

## Conclusion

The API authentication issues have been resolved by:

1. Fixing the CORS configuration to include the `Authorization` header
2. Implementing dual authentication support for both `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer`
3. Creating scripts to verify and synchronize environment variables
4. Updating documentation with detailed setup and troubleshooting instructions

These changes ensure that the CustomGPT can now successfully authenticate with the Full Funnel API and retrieve live data for analytical queries.
