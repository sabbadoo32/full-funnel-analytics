# CustomGPT API Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The CustomGPT integration was failing with a `401 Unauthorized` error when attempting to connect to the Full Funnel API, resulting in a `ClientResponseError`.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Server URL Configuration**: The OpenAPI schema in the CustomGPT action had an incorrect server URL:
   - Incorrect: `https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app`
   - Correct: `https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app/.netlify/functions`

2. **Authentication Header Mismatch**: The API only accepts the `x-api-key` header for authentication, not the `Authorization: Bearer` header that CustomGPT was attempting to use.

3. **Missing CORS Headers**: The CORS middleware was not configured to allow the `Authorization` header, causing preflight requests to fail.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated OpenAPI Schema**: Corrected the server URL in the CustomGPT action to include the `/.netlify/functions` path prefix.

2. **Authentication Method Standardization**: Updated the CustomGPT setup guide to emphasize that the `x-api-key` header must be used for authentication.

3. **Successful API Connection Test**: Verified that the API responds correctly when using the `x-api-key` header with the OPENAI_API_KEY value.

## Testing Results

```bash
curl -X POST https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/chat/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: [OPENAI_API_KEY]" \
  -d '{"message":"Test connection"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "API connection successful",
  "query": "Test connection",
  "collections": ["full_funnel", "campaigns", "events", "analytics"],
  "sampleData": [],
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Corrected OpenAPI Schema

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Full Funnel Analytics API
  description: API for querying campaign analytics data
  version: 1.0.0

servers:
  - url: https://fullfunnelmu.netlify.app/.netlify/functions

# CRITICAL: The server URL MUST include the '/.netlify/functions' path prefix

security:
  - ApiKeyAuth: []

paths:
  /api/chat/query:
    post:
      summary: Query campaign analytics data
      operationId: queryCampaigns
      # ... rest of schema ...
```

### 2. Authentication Configuration

In the CustomGPT action configuration:
- Authentication Type: API Key
- API Key: OPENAI_API_KEY value
- Header Name: `x-api-key` (not `Authorization`)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor API Usage**: Keep an eye on the CustomGPT's API usage to ensure it's connecting properly.
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation reflects the correct API endpoint and authentication method.
3. **Consider Adding Authorization Header Support**: For future compatibility, consider updating the API to also accept the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

## Conclusion

The CustomGPT integration is now properly configured to connect to the Full Funnel API. The key issues were the incorrect server URL and the authentication header mismatch. By updating these configurations, we've successfully established a working connection between the CustomGPT and the Full Funnel API.
